# Creation of a computational linguistic ontology covering the German real estate domain



## Abstract
The abundance of easily accessible real estate data underscores the growing necessity to convert them into machine-readable formats. Ontologies, adept at semantic structuring, are increasingly vital in computational linguistics, machine learning, and AI research, particularly in the expansive realm of real estate. Motivated by this significance, this thesis delves into the fundamentals, creation process, and applicability of an ontology in the German real estate domain, with a special emphasis on visualizing the outcomes. Addressing challenges in categorizing nodes within the ontology structure, the thesis also explores automatic extraction procedures in Named Entity Recognition (NER). The primary objective is to meticulously map the structure of the real estate domain, achieved through the creation of appropriate corpora and the extraction of concepts using computational linguistic methods, culminating in their representation as nodes within a network. The resulting ontology, comprising 4,063 machine-readable terms across 263 concepts, is meticulously validated manually, offering a comprehensive representation of the real estate domainâ€™s semantic structure. To ensure practical applicability, the ontology is visualized as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using NetworkX and further enhanced with Pyvis for intuitive representation in applications.
