# Erstellung einer computerlinguistischen Ontologie in der Dom√§ne Immobilien



## Abstract
With the emergence of large, easily accessible amounts of data, the need to convert these into machine-readable structures is also growing. As ontologies are particularly well suited to the semantic structuring of these data volumes, they are increasingly being used in the fields of computational linguistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence research. Hardly any other area occupies as much economic and social space as that of real estate. Based on this motivation, this thesis deals with the basics, the creation process and the usability of an ontology in the real estate domain, with a special focus on the visual representation of the results. In addition to explaining the problems that arise when categorizing nodes within the ontology structure, automatic extraction procedures in the NER are also discussed. The aim of this work is to map the structure of the real estate domain under investigation as accurately as possible. The focus is on the creation of suitable corpora from which concepts are extracted using computer linguistic methods and then realized as nodes in a network. With 4,063 machine-readable terms from 263 concepts, the ontology created in this thesis represents the real estate domain in its semantic structure with manual verification. In order to be able to represent the ontology in an application-oriented manner, a visual network structure is created using NetworkX as a directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is then visualized using Pyvis.
